This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to the Python Spectral Analysis Tool (PySAT). We’ll cover topics such as getting started, opening data files, visualizing spectra, performing spectral analysis and deriving new data products, and generating figures ready for insertion into publications.

## So what is PySAT, exactly?

PySAT is both a Python (2.7+) library, accessible via an API, and a Graphic User Interface.  This project began as a tool to extract Spectral Profiler data and visualize the resultant spectra.  Slowly, additional functionality was required to perform continuum corrections, interact with plotted data, and apply additional spectral analytics.  

Currently, PySAT support Spectral Profiler, Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), and MI data in all formats supported by GDAL, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library.  PySAT is able to extract spectra, support analysis, and derive 8-bit data products.
